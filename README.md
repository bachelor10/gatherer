# Gatherer

## This was initially meant for gathering data in our bachelors project, it turned out more as a platform for experimenting and working towards our hypothesis, thus it's not something to use other than to get insight into our work. This is not to be delivered.

Directories:
- client
    - js
        - index.js (main functionality)
        - test.js
    - index.html (simple html with input canvas)
    - style.css 
- machine_learning
    - class_model_v2.py (the main classification file)
    - the rest is simply parts of our experimentation stages, their names should explain to some extent their purpose
